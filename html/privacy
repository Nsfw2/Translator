    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>This website does not store the images you post. To reduce the cost of translating the same image for multiple users, it does cache the OCR and translation results from Google, but they are encrypted with a key based on the image so that I won&#39;t be tempted to read them. Logs are kept of the languages selected and the hashes of images translated. There is also a log of the the websites users were linked here from based on the referrer header. Your IP address is stored for about an hour to prevent overuse of the service, after which it is deleted.</p>
    <p>Naturally, all images are sent to Google Cloud Platform for OCR and translation. You can read their policies <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/privacy/">here</a>. Your IP address is not sent to Google unless you follow a link to the Google Translate or another Google site yourself.</p>
    <p>The data collected by hCaptcha is described <a href="https://docs.hcaptcha.com/faq">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Ads on the site may track you with cookies or other methods for the purpose of serving better targeted ads. More specific details will be added when ads are set up.</p>
